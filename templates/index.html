                  Lyme disease, named for the town of Old Lyme, Connecticut, is the common term for the infection caused by the bacterial genus <i>Borrelia</i>. While the disease was only first diagnosed in 1975 and the bacteria only isolated in the 1980s, studies of museum specimens have discovered that Lyme disease has been around for over 5,000 years. Within the United States the two species that cause Lyme disease are <i>B. burgdorferi</i> and, more rarely, <i>B. mayonii</i>, both of which are transmitted primarily through the bite of the blacklegged or deer tick <i>Ixodes scapularis</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the United States it is estimated that roughly 300,000 individuals are infected every year, with the national hotspot resting primarily on New England an the Mid-Atlantic States. Because Lyme disease is carried by an insect vector, or intermediate host, there is significant concern that climate change may result in an increase in infections as the natural range of the vector increases in size. In 2005 Brownstein, Holford, and Fish proposed that North America may see a 213% increase in vector habitat by the year 2080.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lyme disease can affect a variety of species, includes mice, horses, dogs, and humans. In the wild, mice act as the primary reservoir for the bacteria while deer act largely as hosts for the ticks, with denser deer populations resulting in denser tick populations.

                                Lyme disease in both humans and dogs is a serious concern due to both the health effects,
                                which can progress into chronic neurological issues if left untreated, and the economic burden which is
                                estimated to be as high as <strong>$1.3 billion</strong> in the United States every year. The CDC classes Lyme
                                disease as the most common vector-borne disease and over the past 25 years the incident rate has been steadily
                                increasing.

                                Much of this rise is attributed to the reforestation of New Jersey and the surrounding areas that has occurred
                                within the past century. During the mid-1800s the amount of native forests cleared for farmland by English settlers
                                was so extensive that the white-tailed deer almost went extinct in the area. While reforestation has been largely a good development,
                                it has reintroduced historic problems, such as Lyme disease.

                              The New Jersey case per capita rate is over 3 times that of the national rate making it a serious issue for the State
                              of New Jersey. Because Lyme disease is vector-borne, individuals are most at risk in wooded areas, greatly increasing the
                              threat level for some counties compared to others. Right now, one of the primary methods of facing the problem of Lyme disease
                              is active surveillance.

                        Ticks have three distinct life stages; larva, nymphs, and adults. Most cases of Lyme disease are transmitted by nymph, which
                        are about the size of a poppy seed. This is because transmission requires the tick to bite and remain attached to the host
                        for 36-48 hours, and nymphs are much harder to detect than adult ticks.

                    The secondary name for the blacklegged tick is the deer tick, and they
                    gained this name for good reason. In New Jersey the White-tailed Deer is the preferred host for adult ticks,
                    representing a primary stage in the tick reproductive cycle, and high deer population density is often correlated with
                    high tick density. Because of this relationship, many strategies of Lyme disease control focus on deer population control.

                  A 13-year study in a Connecticut residential community found that population control via hunting resulted in an 80% reduction of Lyme
                  disease cases reported by community members. However, the density of deer population in this area was dropped to below 2 deer per square
                  mile, which may not be achievable in New Jersey.

                  As a vector-borne disease Lyme has a very close relationship to a variety of ecological features. This has encouraged researchers to identify events
                  that can predict when a year might have a higher risk of Lyme disease. One event that has been widely proposed as a harbinger of future years of high
                  Lyme cases is the Oak mast year.
              </p>
              <p class="text-center" data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-duration="3000">
                Mast years refer to what is effectively bumper crop years for nut-bearing trees, which in New Jersey’s forests, are primarily Oaks. The casual observer may have
                noticed that some falls there seem to be no acorns on the ground, and other years there are acorns everywhere. These years with overly abundant acorns are the mast
                years for our Oak trees, and occur about every 2-5 years, although weather effects can alter this schedule.
              </p>
              <p class="text-center" data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-duration="3000">
                Acorns play a role in the rate of Lyme disease because acorns provide food for mice, and a bumper crop of acorns allows for mice population to soar. The white-footed
                mouse, or common field mouse, is the primary reservoir of Lyme disease in New Jersey and the primary food source for tick nymphs. This means that mice act effectively
                like a waiting room for the bacteria before being picked up by young ticks. High mouse population allows tick population to also increase in a domino like effect, where
                generally the first year after a mast year becoming the mouse year, and the second year becoming the Lyme year.
